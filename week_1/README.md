# Problem Description

A customer bought four products. If the prices are expressed in dollars, the sum and the product of all the prices (numerically) are the same and amount to $7.77. Prices are rounded to the nearest cent (1 cent).

### Part (a)

Write a program that performs a complete search for all four prices and uses it to determine the prices. Calculate the maximum number of optimization function calls.

### Part (b)

Express one price in terms of the others and write a program that performs a complete search for the remaining three prices. Calculate the maximum number of optimization function calls and compare the speed of the program to the program in Part (a).

### Part (c)

Which of these two programs is faster?
